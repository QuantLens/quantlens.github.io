## Setup

Follow these steps to export TradingView alerts as AI-ready JSON.

1. Add `LLM_JSON_Export_v6.pine` to your chart in TradingView.
2. Create an alert using your strategy/indicator; set the webhook URL to your collector endpoint.
3. Use our collector example to receive and store the JSON.
4. Feed the JSON into your LLM or analytics pipeline.

### Requirements
- TradingView account with alerts
- A reachable webhook endpoint (Node/Express or Python/FastAPI)
- Optional: database or object storage for archiving

### Next
- See the [JSON Schema v1](/docs/json-schema-v1) for available fields.
