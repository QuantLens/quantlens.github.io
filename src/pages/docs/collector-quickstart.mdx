## Collector Quickstart

Minimal Node/Express example to receive TradingView alerts.

```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body; // JSON from TradingView
  console.log('Received:', payload.symbol, payload.time);
  // TODO: store in DB or object storage
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Collector listening on :3000'));
```

Tips:
- Secure the endpoint with a secret token in headers.
- Validate payload shape before processing.
- Consider retries/backoff for downstream failures.
